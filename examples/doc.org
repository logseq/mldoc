* Definitions

This page lists *all hooks, commands and options* of Org 9.0.9.

- *Hooks* :: are options containing functions to be run before or after
     a function.  For example, =org-mode-hook= can contain a list of
     functions to be called after org-mode is turned on.

- *Commands* :: are interactive functions that the user can run with =M-x
     command RET=.  Most commands have an associated keybinding,
     indicated here. Users can bind command to his preferred
     keybinding.

- *Options* :: are variables that the user can set through the =customize=
     interface. Calling =M-x customize-variable RET= then completing
     over availables options will open the custom interface, which
     makes it easy to set an option.

These are the main "internals" that the uesr may want to know about,
and we list them here for further reference.  E.g. You can safely
create links to =https://orgmode.org/worg/doc.html#org-agenda= to refer
to the documentation of the =org-agenda= command.

On top of these symbols, there are other non-interactive /functions/ and
/variables/.  You can get more documentation about them with =C-h f org-
TAB= and =C-h v org- TAB= respectively.

:     3. Otherwise, indent relatively to current level, if
:        ‘org-adapt-indentation’ is non-nil, or to left margin.

:   - On a blank line at the end of an element, indent according to
:     the type of the element.  More precisely
:
:     1. If element is a plain list, an item, or a footnote
:        definition, indent like the very last element within.

:   - In the code part of a source block, use language major mode

:
:   - Otherwise, indent like the first non-blank line above.

: Outline-based notes management and organizer, alias
: "Carsten’s outline-mode for keeping track of everything."
:
: Org mode develops organizational tasks around a NOTES file which
: contains information about projects as plain text.  Org mode is
: implemented on top of Outline mode, which is ideal to keep the content
: of large files well structured.  It supports ToDo items, deadlines and
: time stamps, which magically appear in the diary listing of the Emacs
: calendar.  Tables are easily created with a built-in table editor.
: Plain text URL-like links connect to websites, emails (VM), Usenet
: messages (Gnus), BBDB entries, and any files related to the project.
: For printing and sharing of notes, an Org file (or a part of it)
: can be exported as a structured ASCII or HTML file.

: on the value of the following variables.
:
: ‘org-yank-folded-subtrees’
:     By default, this variable is non-nil, which results in
:     subtree(s) being folded after insertion, except if doing so

:     When non-nil (the default value is nil), the subtree will be
:     promoted or demoted in order to fit into the local outline tree
:     structure, which means that the level will be adjusted so that it
:     becomes the smaller one of the two *visible* surrounding headings.
:
: Any prefix to this command will cause ‘yank’ to be called directly with
: no special treatment.  In particular, a simple ‘C-u’ prefix will just
: plainly yank the text as it is.

: Show all entries that contain a phrase or words or regular expressions.

: TODO entries.  The argument STRING can be used to pass a default search
: string into this function.  If EDIT-AT is non-nil, it means that the
: user should get a chance to edit this string, with cursor at position
: EDIT-AT.
:
: The search string can be viewed either as a phrase that should be found as
: is, or it can be broken into a number of snippets, each of which must match
: in a Boolean way to select an entry.  The default depends on the variable
: ‘org-agenda-search-view-always-boolean’.
: Even if this is turned off (the default) you can always switch to
: Boolean search dynamically by preceding the first word with  "+" or "-".
:
: The default is a direct search of the whole phrase, where each space in
: the search string can expand to an arbitrary amount of whitespace,
: including newlines.
:
: If using a Boolean search, the search string is split on whitespace and
: each snippet is searched separately, with logical AND to select an entry.
: Words prefixed with a minus must *not* occur in the entry.  Words without
: a prefix or prefixed with a plus must occur in the entry.  Matching is
: case-insensitive.  Words are enclosed by word delimiters (i.e. they must
: match whole words, not parts of a word) if
: ‘org-agenda-search-view-force-full-words’ is set (default is nil).
:
: Boolean search snippets enclosed by curly braces are interpreted as
: regular expressions that must or (when preceded with "-") must not
: match in the entry.  Snippets enclosed into double quotes will be taken
: as a whole, to include whitespace.
:
: - If the search string starts with an asterisk, search only in headlines.
: - If (possibly after the leading star) the search string starts with an
:   exclamation mark, this also means to look at TODO entries only, an effect
:   that can also be achieved with a prefix argument.
: - If (possibly after star and exclamation mark) the search string starts
:   with a colon, this will mean that the (non-regexp) snippets of the
:   Boolean search must match as full words.

: Clone the task (subtree) at point N times.
: The clones will be inserted as siblings.
:
: In interactive use, the user will be prompted for the number of
: clones to be produced.  If the entry has a timestamp, the user
: will also be prompted for a time shift, which may be a repeater
: as used in time stamps, for example ‘+3d’.  To disable this,
: you can call the function with a universal prefix argument.
:
: When a valid repeater is given and the entry contains any time
: stamps, the clones will become a sequence in time, with time
: stamps in the subtree shifted for each clone produced.  If SHIFT
: is nil or the empty string, time stamps will be left alone.  The
: ID property of the original subtree is removed.
:
: In each clone, all the CLOCK entries will be removed.  This
: prevents Org from considering that the clocked times overlap.
:
: If the original subtree did contain time stamps with a repeater,
: the following will happen:
: - the repeater will be removed in each clone
: - an additional clone will be produced, with the current, unshifted
:   date(s) in the entry.
: - the original entry will be placed *after* all the clones, with
:   repeater intact.
: - the start days in the repeater in the original entry will be shifted
:   to past the last clone.
: In this way you can spell out a number of instances of a repeating task,
: and still retain the repeater to cover future instances of the task.
:
: As described above, N+1 clones are produced when the original
: subtree has a repeater.  Setting N to 0, then, can be used to
: remove the repeater from a subtree and create a shifted clone
: with the original repeater.

: TAB-action and visibility cycling for Org mode.
:
: This is the command invoked in Org mode by the ‘TAB’ key.  Its main
: purpose is outline visibility cycling, but it also invokes other actions
: in special contexts.
:
: When this function is called with a ‘C-u’ prefix, rotate the entire
: buffer through 3 states (global cycling)
:   1. OVERVIEW: Show only top-level headlines.
:   2. CONTENTS: Show all headlines of all levels, but no body text.
:   3. SHOW ALL: Show everything.
:
: With a ‘C-u C-u’ prefix argument, switch to the startup visibility,
: determined by the variable ‘org-startup-folded’, and by any VISIBILITY
: properties in the buffer.
:
: With a ‘C-u C-u C-u’ prefix argument, show the entire buffer, including
: any drawers.
:
: When inside a table, re-align the table and move to the next field.
:
: When point is at the beginning of a headline, rotate the subtree started
: by this line through 3 different states (local cycling)
:   1. FOLDED:   Only the main headline is shown.
:   2. CHILDREN: The main headline and the direct children are shown.
:                From this state, you can move to one of the children
:                and zoom in further.
:   3. SUBTREE:  Show the entire subtree, including body text.
: If there is no subtree, switch directly from CHILDREN to FOLDED.
:
: When point is at the beginning of an empty headline and the variable
: ‘org-cycle-level-after-item/entry-creation’ is set, cycle the level
: of the headline by demoting and promoting it to likely levels.  This
: speeds up creation document structure by pressing ‘TAB’ once or several
: times right after creating a new headline.
:
: When there is a numeric prefix, go up to a heading with level ARG, do
: a ‘show-subtree’ and return to the previous cursor position.  If ARG
: is negative, go up that many levels.
:
: When point is not at the beginning of a headline, execute the global
: binding for ‘TAB’, which is re-indenting the line.  See the option
: ‘org-cycle-emulate-tab’ for details.
:
: As a special case, if point is at the beginning of the buffer and there is
: no headline in line 1, this function will act as if called with prefix arg
: (‘C-u TAB’, same as ‘S-TAB’) also when called without prefix arg, but only
: if the variable ‘org-cycle-global-at-bob’ is t.

: An alist with five entries, each for the different agenda types.  The
: keys of the sublists are `agenda', `timeline', `todo', `search' and `tags'.

:
: This format works similar to a printf format, with the following meaning:
:

:        or as given by the CATEGORY keyword or derived from the file name
:   %e   the effort required by the item

:   %b   show breadcrumbs, i.e., the names of the higher levels
:   %(expression) Eval EXPRESSION and replace the control string
:                 by the result
:
: All specifiers work basically like the standard `%s' of printf, but may
: contain two additional characters: a question mark just after the `%'
: and a whitespace/punctuation character just before the final letter.
:
: If the first character after `%' is a question mark, the entire field
: will only be included if the corresponding value applies to the current
: entry.  This is useful for fields which should have fixed width when
: present, but zero width when absent.  For example, "%?-12t" will
: result in a 12 character time field if a time of the day is specified,
: but will completely disappear in entries which do not contain a time.
:
: If there is punctuation or whitespace character just before the
: final format letter, this character will be appended to the field
: value if the value is not empty.  For example, the format
: "%-12:c" leads to "Diary: " if the category is "Diary".  If
: the category is empty, no additional colon is inserted.
:
: The default value for the agenda sublist is "  %-12:c%?-12t% s",
: which means:
:
: - Indent the line with two space characters
: - Give the category a 12 chars wide field, padded with whitespace on
:   the right (because of `-').  Append a colon if there is a category
:   (because of `:').
: - If there is a time-of-day, put it into a 12 chars wide field.  If no
:   time, don't put in an empty field, just skip it (because of '?').
: - Finally, put the scheduling information.

:  x_{i^2} or   x^(2-i)    braces or parenthesis do grouping.
:
: Still, ambiguity is possible.  So when in doubt, use {} to enclose
: the sub/superscript.  If you set this variable to the symbol `{}',
: the braces are *required* in order to trigger interpretations as

: Templates for the creation of new entries.
:
: Each entry is a list with the following items:
:
: keys         The keys that will select the template, as a string, characters
:              only, for example "a" for a template to be selected with a
:              single key, or "bt" for selection with two keys.  When using
:              several keys, keys using the same prefix key must be together
:              in the list and preceded by a 2-element entry explaining the
:              prefix key, for example
:
:                      ("b" "Templates for marking stuff to buy")
:
:              The "C" key is used by default for quick access to the
:              customization of the template variable.  But if you want to use
:              that key for a template, you can.
:
: description  A short string describing the template, will be shown during
:              selection.
:
: type         The type of entry.  Valid types are:
:                entry       an Org node, with a headline.  Will be filed
:                            as the child of the target entry or as a
:                            top-level entry.
:                item        a plain list item, will be placed in the
:                            first plain list at the target
:                            location.
:                checkitem   a checkbox item.  This differs from the
:                            plain list item only is so far as it uses a
:                            different default template.
:                table-line  a new line in the first table at target location.
:                plain       text to be inserted as it is.
:
: target       Specification of where the captured item should be placed.
:              In Org files, targets usually define a node.  Entries will
:              become children of this node, other types will be added to the
:              table or list in the body of this node.
:
:              Most target specifications contain a file name.  If that file
:              name is the empty string, it defaults to `org-default-notes-file'.
:              A file can also be given as a variable or as a function called
:              with no argument.  When an absolute path is not specified for a
:              target, it is taken as relative to `org-directory'.
:
:              Valid values are:
:
:              (file "path/to/file")
:                  Text will be placed at the beginning or end of that file
:
:              (id "id of existing Org entry")
:                  File as child of this entry, or in the body of the entry
:
:              (file+headline "path/to/file" "node headline")
:                  Fast configuration if the target heading is unique in the file
:
:              (file+olp "path/to/file" "Level 1 heading" "Level 2" ...)
:                  For non-unique headings, the full outline path is safer
:
:              (file+regexp  "path/to/file" "regexp to find location")
:                  File to the entry matching regexp
:
:              (file+olp+datetree "path/to/file" "Level 1 heading" ...)
:                  Will create a heading in a date tree for today's date.
:                  If no heading is given, the tree will be on top level.
:                  To prompt for date instead of using TODAY, use the
:                  :time-prompt property.  To create a week-tree, use the
:                  :tree-type property.
:
:              (file+function "path/to/file" function-finding-location)
:                  A function to find the right location in the file
:
:              (clock)
:                 File to the entry that is currently being clocked
:
:              (function function-finding-location)
:                 Most general way: write your own function which both visits
:                 the file and moves point to the right location
:
: template     The template for creating the capture item.  If you leave this
:              empty, an appropriate default template will be used.  See below
:              for more details.  Instead of a string, this may also be one of
:
:                  (file "/path/to/template-file")
:                  (function function-returning-the-template)
:
:              in order to get a template from a file, or dynamically
:              from a function.
:
: The rest of the entry is a property list of additional options.  Recognized
: properties are:
:
:  :prepend            Normally newly captured information will be appended at
:                      the target location (last child, last table line,
:                      last list item...).  Setting this property will
:                      change that.
:
:  :immediate-finish   When set, do not offer to edit the information, just
:                      file it away immediately.  This makes sense if the
:                      template only needs information that can be added
:                      automatically.
:
:  :jump-to-captured   When set, jump to the captured entry when finished.
:
:  :empty-lines        Set this to the number of lines the should be inserted
:                      before and after the new item.  Default 0, only common
:                      other value is 1.
:
:  :empty-lines-before Set this to the number of lines the should be inserted
:                      before the new item.  Overrides :empty-lines for the
:                      number lines inserted before.
:
:  :empty-lines-after  Set this to the number of lines the should be inserted
:                      after the new item.  Overrides :empty-lines for the
:                      number of lines inserted after.
:
:  :clock-in           Start the clock in this item.
:
:  :clock-keep         Keep the clock running when filing the captured entry.
:
:  :clock-resume       Start the interrupted clock when finishing the capture.
:                      Note that :clock-keep has precedence over :clock-resume.
:                      When setting both to t, the current clock will run and
:                      the previous one will not be resumed.
:
:  :time-prompt        Prompt for a date/time to be used for date/week trees
:                      and when filling the template.
:
:  :tree-type          When `week', make a week tree instead of the month tree.
:
:  :unnarrowed         Do not narrow the target buffer, simply show the
:                      full buffer.  Default is to narrow it so that you
:                      only see the new stuff.
:
:  :table-line-pos     Specification of the location in the table where the
:                      new line should be inserted.  It should be a string like
:                      "II-3", meaning that the new line should become the
:                      third line before the second horizontal separator line.
:
:  :kill-buffer        If the target file was not yet visited by a buffer when
:                      capture was invoked, kill the buffer again after capture
:                      is finalized.
:
: The template defines the text to be inserted.  Often this is an
: Org mode entry (so the first line should start with a star) that
: will be filed as a child of the target headline.  It can also be
: freely formatted text.  Furthermore, the following %-escapes will
: be replaced with content and expanded:
:
:   %[pathname] Insert the contents of the file given by
:               `pathname'.  These placeholders are expanded at the very
:               beginning of the process so they can be used to extend the
:               current template.
:   %(sexp)     Evaluate elisp `(sexp)' and replace it with the results.
:               Only placeholders pre-existing within the template, or
:               introduced with %[pathname] are expanded this way.  Since this
:               happens after expanding non-interactive %-escapes, those can
:               be used to fill the expression.
:   %<...>      The result of format-time-string on the ... format specification.
:   %t          Time stamp, date only.
:   %T          Time stamp with date and time.
:   %u, %U      Like the above, but inactive time stamps.
:   %i          Initial content, copied from the active region.  If %i is
:               indented, the entire inserted text will be indented as well.
:   %a          Annotation, normally the link created with `org-store-link'.
:   %A          Like %a, but prompt for the description part.
:   %l          Like %a, but only insert the literal link.
:   %c          Current kill ring head.
:   %x          Content of the X clipboard.
:   %k          Title of currently clocked task.
:   %K          Link to currently clocked task.
:   %n          User name (taken from the variable `user-full-name').
:   %f          File visited by current buffer when org-capture was called.
:   %F          Full path of the file or directory visited by current buffer.
:   %:keyword   Specific information for certain link types, see below.
:   %^g         Prompt for tags, with completion on tags in target file.
:   %^G         Prompt for tags, with completion on all tags in all agenda files.
:   %^t         Like %t, but prompt for date.  Similarly %^T, %^u, %^U.
:               You may define a prompt like: %^{Please specify birthday}t
:   %^C         Interactive selection of which kill or clip to use.
:   %^L         Like %^C, but insert as link.
:   %^{prop}p   Prompt the user for a value for property `prop'.
:   %^{prompt}  Prompt the user for a string and replace this sequence with it.
:               A default value and a completion table ca be specified like this:
:               %^{prompt|default|completion2|completion3|...}.
:   %?          After completing the template, position cursor here.
:   %\1 ... %\N Insert the text entered at the nth %^{prompt}, where N
:               is a number, starting from 1.
:
: Apart from these general escapes, you can access information specific to
: the link type that is created.  For example, calling `org-capture' in emails
: or in Gnus will record the author and the subject of the message, which you
: can access with "%:from" and "%:subject", respectively.  Here is a

:

:  10^-12  or   10^-tau    a leading sign with digits or a word
:  x^2-y^3                 will be read as x^2 - y^3, because items are
: 			 terminated by almost any nonword/nondigit char.
:  x_{i^2} or   x^(2-i)    braces or parenthesis do grouping.
:
: Still, ambiguity is possible.  So when in doubt, use {} to enclose
: the sub/superscript.  If you set this variable to the symbol `{}',
: the braces are *required* in order to trigger interpretations as
: sub/superscript.  This can be helpful in documents that need "_"

: %s in the filename will be replaced by the current file

:

: the heading you can use %s to represent the file name, this can be
: useful when using the same archive for a number of different files.
:

:
: "~/org/archive.org::* From %s"
: 	Archive in file ~/org/archive.org (absolute path), under headlines
:         "From FILENAME" where file name is the current file name.
:
: "~/org/datetree.org::datetree/* Finished Tasks"
:         The "datetree/" string is special, signifying to archive
:         items to the datetree.  Items are placed in either the CLOSED
:         date of the item, or the current date if there is no CLOSED date.
:         The heading will be a subentry to the current date.  There doesn't
:         need to be a heading, but there always needs to be a slash after
:         datetree.  For example, to store archived items directly in the
:         datetree, use "~/org/datetree.org::datetree/".
:
: "basement::** Finished Tasks"
: 	Archive in file ./basement (relative path), as level 3 trees

:
: You may set this option on a per-file basis by adding to the buffer a

:

: a "H:MM:SS" or "H:MM" string.
:
: Alternatively, the value can be a list of entries following the
: pattern:
:
:   (UNIT . REQUIRED?)
:
: UNIT is a unit string, as defined in `org-duration-units'.  The
: time duration is formatted using only the time components that
: are specified here.
:
: Units with a zero value are skipped, unless REQUIRED? is non-nil.
: In that case, the unit is always used.
:
: Eventually, the list can contain one of the following special
: entries:
:
:   (special . h:mm)
:   (special . h:mm:ss)
:
:     Units shorter than an hour are ignored.  The hours and
:     minutes part of the duration is expressed unconditionally
:     with H:MM, or H:MM:SS, pattern.
:
:   (special . PRECISION)
:
:     A duration is expressed with a single unit, PRECISION being
:     the number of decimal places to show.  The unit chosen is the
:     first one required or with a non-zero integer part.  If there
:     is no such unit, the smallest one is used.
:
: For example,
:
:    (("d" . nil) ("h" . t) ("min" . t))
:
: means a duration longer than a day is expressed in days, hours
: and minutes, whereas a duration shorter than a day is always
: expressed in hours and minutes, even when shorter than an hour.
:
: On the other hand, the value
:
:   (("d" . nil) ("min" . nil))
:
: means a duration longer than a day is expressed in days and
: minutes, whereas a duration shorter than a day is expressed
: entirely in minutes, even when longer than an hour.
:
: The following format
:
:   (("d" . nil) (special . h:mm))
:
: means that any duration longer than a day is expressed with both
: a "d" unit and a "H:MM" part, whereas a duration shorter than
: a day is expressed only as a "H:MM" string.
:
: Eventually,
:
:   (("d" . nil) ("h" . nil) (special . 2))
:
: expresses a duration longer than a day as a decimal number, with
: a 2-digits fractional part, of "d" unit.  A duration shorter
: than a day uses "h" unit instead.

: Non-nil means make shift-cursor commands select text when possible.

: In Org mode, in special contexts, these same keys are used for
: other purposes, important enough to compete with shift selection.
: Org tries to balance these needs by supporting `shift-select-mode'
: outside these special contexts, under control of this variable.
:
: The default of this variable is nil, to avoid confusing behavior.  Shifted
: cursor keys will then execute Org commands in the following contexts:
: - on a headline, changing TODO state (left/right) and priority (up/down)
: - on a time stamp, changing the time
: - in a plain list item, changing the bullet type
: - in a property definition line, switching between allowed values
: - in the BEGIN line of a clock table (changing the time block).
: Outside these contexts, the commands will throw an error.
:
: When this variable is t and the cursor is not in a special
: context, Org mode will support shift-selection for making and
: enlarging regions.  To make this more effective, the bullet
: cycling will no longer happen anywhere in an item line, but only
: if the cursor is exactly on the bullet.
:
: If you set this variable to the symbol `always', then the keys
: will not be special in headlines, property lines, and item lines,
: to make shift selection work there as well.  If this is what you
: want, you can use the following alternative commands:
: `\[org-todo]' and `\[org-priority]' to change TODO state and priority,
: `\[universal-argument] \[universal-argument] \[org-todo]' can be used to switch TODO sets,
: `\[org-ctrl-c-minus]' to cycle item bullet types,
: and properties can be edited by hand or in column view.

: Alist of LaTeX classes and associated header and structure.

: associated information.  Here is the structure of each cell:
:
:   (class-name
:     header-string
:     (numbered-section . unnumbered-section)
:     ...)
:
: The header string
: -----------------
:
: The HEADER-STRING is the header that will be inserted into the
: LaTeX file.  It should contain the \documentclass macro, and
: anything else that is needed for this setup.  To this header, the
: following commands will be added:
:
: - Calls to \usepackage for all packages mentioned in the
:   variables `org-latex-default-packages-alist' and
:   `org-latex-packages-alist'.  Thus, your header definitions
:   should avoid to also request these packages.
:
: - Lines specified via "#+LATEX_HEADER:" and
:   "#+LATEX_HEADER_EXTRA:" keywords.
:
: If you need more control about the sequence in which the header
: is built up, or if you want to exclude one of these building
: blocks for a particular class, you can use the following
: macro-like placeholders.
:
:  [DEFAULT-PACKAGES]      \usepackage statements for default packages
:  [NO-DEFAULT-PACKAGES]   do not include any of the default packages
:  [PACKAGES]              \usepackage statements for packages
:  [NO-PACKAGES]           do not include the packages
:  [EXTRA]                 the stuff from #+LATEX_HEADER(_EXTRA)
:  [NO-EXTRA]              do not include #+LATEX_HEADER(_EXTRA) stuff
:
: So a header like
:
:   \documentclass{article}
:   [NO-DEFAULT-PACKAGES]
:   [EXTRA]
:   \providecommand{\alert}[1]{\textbf{#1}}
:   [PACKAGES]
:
: will omit the default packages, and will include the
: #+LATEX_HEADER and #+LATEX_HEADER_EXTRA lines, then have a call
: to \providecommand, and then place \usepackage commands based
: on the content of `org-latex-packages-alist'.
:
: If your header, `org-latex-default-packages-alist' or
: `org-latex-packages-alist' inserts "\usepackage[AUTO]{inputenc}",
: AUTO will automatically be replaced with a coding system derived
: from `buffer-file-coding-system'.  See also the variable
: `org-latex-inputenc-alist' for a way to influence this mechanism.
:
: Likewise, if your header contains "\usepackage[AUTO]{babel}"
: or "\usepackage[AUTO]{polyglossia}", AUTO will be replaced
: with the language related to the language code specified by
: `org-export-default-language'.  Note that constructions such as
: "\usepackage[french,AUTO,english]{babel}" are permitted.  For
: Polyglossia the language will be set via the macros
: "\setmainlanguage" and "\setotherlanguage".  See also
: `org-latex-guess-babel-language' and
: `org-latex-guess-polyglossia-language'.
:
: The sectioning structure
: ------------------------
:
: The sectioning structure of the class is given by the elements
: following the header string.  For each sectioning level, a number
: of strings is specified.  A %s formatter is mandatory in each
: section string and will be replaced by the title of the section.
:
: Instead of a cons cell (numbered . unnumbered), you can also
: provide a list of 2 or 4 elements,
:
:   (numbered-open numbered-close)
:
: or
:
:   (numbered-open numbered-close unnumbered-open unnumbered-close)
:
: providing opening and closing strings for a LaTeX environment
: that should represent the document section.  The opening clause
: should have a %s to represent the section title.
:
: Instead of a list of sectioning commands, you can also specify
: a function name.  That function will be called with two
: parameters, the (reduced) level of the headline, and a predicate
: non-nil when the headline should be numbered.  It must return
: a format string in which the section title will be added.

: List of TODO entry keyword sequences and their interpretation.
: \<org-mode-map>This is a list of sequences.
:
: Each sequence starts with a symbol, either `sequence' or `type',
: indicating if the keywords should be interpreted as a sequence of
: action steps, or as different types of TODO items.  The first
: keywords are states requiring action - these states will select a headline
: for inclusion into the global TODO list Org produces.  If one of the
: "keywords" is the vertical bar, "|", the remaining keywords
: signify that no further action is necessary.  If "|" is not found,
: the last keyword is treated as the only DONE state of the sequence.
:
: The command `\[org-todo]' cycles an entry through these states, and one
: additional state where no keyword is present.  For details about this
: cycling, see the manual.
:
: TODO keywords and interpretation can also be set on a per-file basis with
: the special #+SEQ_TODO and #+TYP_TODO lines.
:
: Each keyword can optionally specify a character for fast state selection
: (in combination with the variable `org-use-fast-todo-selection')
: and specifiers for state change logging, using the same syntax that
: is used in the "#+TODO:" lines.  For example, "WAIT(w)" says that
: the WAIT state can be selected with the "w" key.  "WAIT(w!)"
: indicates to record a time stamp each time this state is selected.
:
: Each keyword may also specify if a timestamp or a note should be
: recorded when entering or leaving the state, by adding additional
: characters in the parenthesis after the keyword.  This looks like this:
: "WAIT(w@/!)".  "@" means to add a note (with time), "!" means to
: record only the time of the state change.  With X and Y being either
: "@" or "!", "X/Y" means use X when entering the state, and use
: Y when leaving the state if and only if the *target* state does not
: define X.  You may omit any of the fast-selection key or X or /Y,
: so WAIT(w@), WAIT(w/@) and WAIT(@/@) are all valid.
:
: For backward compatibility, this variable may also be just a list
: of keywords.  In this case the interpretation (sequence or type) will be
: taken from the (otherwise obsolete) variable `org-todo-interpretation'.

: Register custom handlers for org-protocol.

: protocol - protocol to detect in a filename without trailing
:            colon and slashes.  See rfc1738 section 2.1 for more
:            on this.  If you define a protocol "my-protocol",
:            `org-protocol-check-filename-for-protocol' will search
:            filenames for "org-protocol:/my-protocol" and
:            trigger your action for every match.  `org-protocol'
:            is defined in `org-protocol-the-protocol'.  Double and
:            triple slashes are compressed to one by emacsclient.
:
: function - function that handles requests with protocol and takes
:            one argument.  If a new-style link (key=val&key2=val2)
:            is given, the argument will be a property list with
:            the values from the link.  If an old-style link is
:            given (val1/val2), the argument will be the filename
:            with all protocols stripped.
:
:            If the function returns nil, emacsclient and -server
:            do nothing.  Any non-nil return value is considered a
:            valid filename and thus passed to the server.
:
:            `org-protocol.el' provides some support for handling
:            old-style filenames, if you follow the conventions
:            used for the standard handlers in
:            `org-protocol-protocol-alist-default'.  See
:            `org-protocol-parse-parameters'.
:
: kill-client - If t, kill the client immediately, once the sub-protocol is
:            detected.  This is necessary for actions that can be interrupted by
:            `C-g' to avoid dangling emacsclients.  Note that all other command
:            line arguments but the this one will be discarded.  Greedy handlers
:            still receive the whole list of arguments though.

: Use user-provided labels instead of internal ones when non-nil.
:
: When this variable is non-nil, Org will use the value of
: CUSTOM_ID property, NAME keyword or Org target as the key for the
: \label commands generated.
:
: By default, Org generates its own internal labels during LaTeX
: export.  This process ensures that the \label keys are unique
: and valid, but it means the keys are not available in advance of
: the export process.
:
: Setting this variable gives you control over how Org generates
: labels during LaTeX export, so that you may know their keys in
: advance.  One reason to do this is that it allows you to refer to
: various elements using a single label both in Org's link syntax
: and in embedded LaTeX code.
:
: For example, when this variable is non-nil, a headline like this:
:
:   ** Some section
:      :PROPERTIES:
:      :CUSTOM_ID: sec:foo
:      :END:

: will be exported to LaTeX as:
:
:   \subsection{Some section}
:   \label{sec:foo}
:   This is section \ref{sec:foo}.
:   And this is still section \ref{sec:foo}.
:
: Note, however, that setting this variable introduces a limitation
: on the possible values for CUSTOM_ID and NAME.  When this
: variable is non-nil, Org passes their value to \label unchanged.
: You are responsible for ensuring that the value is a valid LaTeX
: \label key, and that no other \label commands with the same key
: appear elsewhere in your document.  (Keys may contain letters,
: numbers, and the following punctuation: '_' '.'  '-' ':'.)  There
: are no such limitations on CUSTOM_ID and NAME when this variable
: is nil.
:
: For headlines that do not define the CUSTOM_ID property or
: elements without a NAME, Org will continue to use its default
: labeling scheme to generate labels and resolve links into proper
: references.

:                ways, depending on its contents:
:
:                - Alphanumeric characters only:
:                  Match links with this file extension.
:                  Example: ("pdf" . "evince %s")
:                           to open PDFs with evince.
:
:                - Regular expression: Match links where the
:                  filename matches the regexp.  If you want to
:                  use groups here, use shy groups.
:
:                  Example: ("\\.x?html\\\='" . "firefox %s")
:                           ("\\(?:xhtml\\|html\\)\\\='" . "firefox %s")
:                           to open *.html and *.xhtml with firefox.
:
:                - Regular expression which contains (non-shy) groups:
:                  Match links where the whole link, including "::", and
:                  anything after that, matches the regexp.
:                  In a custom command string, %1, %2, etc. are replaced with
:                  the parts of the link that were matched by the groups.
:                  For backwards compatibility, if a command string is given
:                  that does not use any of the group matches, this case is
:                  handled identically to the second one (i.e. match against
:                  file name only).
:                  In a custom function, you can access the group matches with
:                  (match-string n link).
:
:                  Example: ("\\.pdf::\\(\\d+\\)\\\='" . "evince -p %1 %s")
:                      to open [[file:document.pdf::5]] with evince at page 5.
:
:  `directory'   Matches a directory
:  `remote'      Matches a remote file, accessible through tramp or efs.
:                Remote files most likely should be visited through Emacs
:                because external applications cannot handle such paths.
: `auto-mode'    Matches files that are matched by any entry in `auto-mode-alist',
:                so all files Emacs knows how to handle.  Using this with
:                command `emacs' will open most files in Emacs.  Beware that this
:                will also open html files inside Emacs, unless you add
:                ("html" . default) to the list as well.
:  `system'      The system command to open files, like `open' on Windows
:                and macOS, and mailcap under GNU/Linux.  This is the command
:                that will be selected if you call `org-open-at-point' with a
:                double prefix argument (`\[universal-argument] \[universal-argument] \[org-open-at-point]').

:
: Possible values for the command are:
:
:  `emacs'       The file will be visited by the current Emacs process.
:  `default'     Use the default application for this file type, which is the

:                part.  This can be used to overrule an unwanted setting in the
:                system-specific variable.
:  `system'      Use the system command for opening files, like "open".
:                This command is specified by the entry whose car is `system'.
:                Most likely, the system-specific version of this variable
:                does define this command, but you can overrule/replace it
:                here.
: `mailcap'      Use command specified in the mailcaps.
:  string        A command to be executed by a shell; %s will be replaced
:                by the path to the file.
:  function      A Lisp function, which will be called with two arguments:

: Association list to control publishing behavior.
: \<org-mode-map>
: Each element of the alist is a publishing project.  The car of
: each element is a string, uniquely identifying the project.  The
: cdr of each element is in one of the following forms:
:
: 1. A well-formed property list with an even number of elements,
:    alternating keys and values, specifying parameters for the
:    publishing process.
:
:      (:property value :property value ... )
:
: 2. A meta-project definition, specifying of a list of
:    sub-projects:
:
:      (:components ("project-1" "project-2" ...))
:
: When the CDR of an element of org-publish-project-alist is in
: this second form, the elements of the list after `:components'
: are taken to be components of the project, which group together
: files requiring different publishing options.  When you publish
: such a project with `\[org-publish]', the components all publish.
:
: When a property is given a value in `org-publish-project-alist',
: its setting overrides the value of the corresponding user
: variable (if any) during publishing.  However, options set within
: a file override everything.
:
: Most properties are optional, but some should always be set:
:
:   `:base-directory'
:
:     Directory containing publishing source files.
:
:   `:base-extension'
:
:     Extension (without the dot!) of source files.  This can be
:     a regular expression.  If not given, "org" will be used as
:     default extension.  If it is `any', include all the files,
:     even without extension.
:
:   `:publishing-directory'
:
:     Directory (possibly remote) where output files will be
:     published.
:
: If `:recursive' is non-nil files in sub-directories of
: `:base-directory' are considered.
:
: The `:exclude' property may be used to prevent certain files from
: being published.  Its value may be a string or regexp matching
: file names you don't want to be published.
:
: The `:include' property may be used to include extra files.  Its
: value may be a list of filenames to include.  The filenames are
: considered relative to the base directory.
:
: When both `:include' and `:exclude' properties are given values,
: the exclusion step happens first.
:
: One special property controls which back-end function to use for
: publishing files in the project.  This can be used to extend the
: set of file types publishable by `org-publish', as well as the
: set of output formats.
:
:   `:publishing-function'
:
:     Function to publish file.  Each back-end may define its
:     own (i.e. `org-latex-publish-to-pdf',
:     `org-html-publish-to-html').  May be a list of functions, in
:     which case each function in the list is invoked in turn.
:
: Another property allows you to insert code that prepares
: a project for publishing.  For example, you could call GNU Make
: on a certain makefile, to ensure published files are built up to
: date.
:
:   `:preparation-function'
:
:     Function to be called before publishing this project.  This
:     may also be a list of functions.  Preparation functions are
:     called with the project properties list as their sole
:     argument.
:
:   `:completion-function'
:
:     Function to be called after publishing this project.  This
:     may also be a list of functions.  Completion functions are
:     called with the project properties list as their sole
:     argument.
:
: Some properties control details of the Org publishing process,
: and are equivalent to the corresponding user variables listed in
: the right column.  Back-end specific properties may also be
: included.  See the back-end documentation for more information.

: The following properties may be used to control publishing of
: a site-map of files or summary page for a given project.
:
:   `:auto-sitemap'
:
:     Whether to publish a site-map during
:     `org-publish-current-project' or `org-publish-all'.
:
:   `:sitemap-filename'
:
:     Filename for output of site-map.  Defaults to "sitemap.org".
:
:   `:sitemap-title'
:
:     Title of site-map page.  Defaults to name of file.
:
:   `:sitemap-style'
:
:     Can be `list' (site-map is just an itemized list of the
:     titles of the files involved) or `tree' (the directory
:     structure of the source files is reflected in the site-map).
:     Defaults to `tree'.
:
:   `:sitemap-format-entry'
:
:     Plugin function used to format entries in the site-map.  It
:     is called with three arguments: the file or directory name
:     relative to base directory, the site map style and the
:     current project.  It has to return a string.
:
:     Defaults to `org-publish-sitemap-default-entry', which turns
:     file names into links and use document titles as
:     descriptions.  For specific formatting needs, one can use
:     `org-publish-find-date', `org-publish-find-title' and
:     `org-publish-find-property', to retrieve additional
:     information about published documents.
:
:   `:sitemap-function'
:
:     Plugin function to use for generation of site-map.  It is
:     called with two arguments: the title of the site-map, as
:     a string, and a representation of the files involved in the
:     project, as returned by `org-list-to-lisp'.  The latter can
:     further be transformed using `org-list-to-generic',
:     `org-list-to-subtree' and alike.  It has to return a string.
:
:     Defaults to `org-publish-sitemap-default', which generates
:     a plain list of links to all files in the project.
:
: If you create a site-map file, adjust the sorting like this:
:
:   `:sitemap-sort-folders'
:
:     Where folders should appear in the site-map.  Set this to
:     `first' or `last' to display folders first or last,
:     respectively.  When set to `ignore' (default), folders are
:     ignored altogether.  Any other value will mix files and
:     folders.  This variable has no effect when site-map style is
:     `tree'.
:
:   `:sitemap-sort-files'
:
:     The site map is normally sorted alphabetically.  You can
:     change this behavior setting this to `anti-chronologically',
:     `chronologically', or nil.
:
:   `:sitemap-ignore-case'
:
:     Should sorting be case-sensitive?  Default nil.
:
: The following property control the creation of a concept index.
:
:   `:makeindex'
:
:     Create a concept index.  The file containing the index has to
:     be called "theindex.org".  If it doesn't exist in the
:     project, it will be generated.  Contents of the index are
:     stored in the file "theindex.inc", which can be included in
:     "theindex.org".
:
: Other properties affecting publication.
:
:   `:body-only'
:
:     Set this to t to publish only the body of the documents.

:
:    (key desc type match settings files)
:
: key      The key (one or more characters as a string) to be associated
:          with the command.
: desc     A description of the command, when omitted or nil, a default
:          description is built using MATCH.
: type     The command type, any of the following symbols:
:           agenda      The daily/weekly agenda.
:           todo        Entries with a specific TODO keyword, in all agenda files.
:           search      Entries containing search words entry or headline.
:           tags        Tags/Property/TODO match in all agenda files.
:           tags-todo   Tags/P/T match in all agenda files, TODO entries only.
:           todo-tree   Sparse tree of specific TODO keyword in *current* file.
:           tags-tree   Sparse tree with all tags matches in *current* file.
:           occur-tree  Occur sparse tree for *current* file.
:           ...         A user-defined function.
: match    What to search for:
:           - a single keyword for TODO keyword searches
:           - a tags match expression for tags searches
:           - a word search expression for text searches.
:           - a regular expression for occur searches
:           For all other commands, this should be the empty string.
: settings  A list of option settings, similar to that in a let form, so like
:           this: ((opt1 val1) (opt2 val2) ...).   The values will be
:           evaluated at the moment of execution, so quote them when needed.
: files     A list of files to write the produced agenda buffer to with
:           the command `org-store-agenda-views'.
:           If a file name ends in ".html", an HTML version of the buffer
:           is written out.  If it ends in ".ps", a postscript version is
:           produced.  Otherwise, only the plain text is written to the file.
:
: You can also define a set of commands, to create a composite agenda buffer.
: In this case, an entry looks like this:
:
:   (key desc (cmd1 cmd2 ...) general-settings-for-whole-set files)
:
: where
:
: desc   A description string to be displayed in the dispatcher menu.
: cmd    An agenda command, similar to the above.  However, tree commands
:        are not allowed, but instead you can get agenda and global todo list.
:        So valid commands for a set are:
:        (agenda "" settings)
:        (alltodo "" settings)
:        (stuck "" settings)
:        (todo "match" settings files)
:        (search "match" settings files)
:        (tags "match" settings files)
:        (tags-todo "match" settings files)
:
: Each command can carry a list of options, and another set of options can be
: given for the whole set of commands.  Individual command options take
: precedence over the general options.
:
: When using several characters as key to a command, the first characters
: are prefix commands.  For the dispatcher to display useful information, you
: should provide a description for the prefix, like
:
:  (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
:    \='(("h" . "HOME + Name tag searches") ; describe prefix "h"
:      ("hl" tags "+HOME+Lisa")
:      ("hp" tags "+HOME+Peter")
